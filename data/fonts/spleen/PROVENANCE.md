# Spleen 2.1.0

Data, not code (principle 29): the bitmap font of the framebuffer console
(M3j), chosen 2026-10-10. `fontgen` reads the BDF files and writes
`lib/console/generated/Spleen.swift`, which keeps Spleen's license, the
BSD 2-Clause license (`LICENSE`, copied from the release), and its
copyright notice; it is not relabelled BSD-3-Clause. The files are
unmodified.
