// A lock over futexes, the kernel's waiting on a word in memory: free and
// uncontended locks cost an atomic each way and no kernel call. The word
// is 0 (free), 1 (held) or 2 (held, and someone may be waiting), the
// classic three-state design (Drepper, "Futexes Are Tricky", mutex 3):
// an unlock that finds 2 wakes one waiter, and a waiter marks the word 2
// before it sleeps, so no wakeup is lost.
//
// Not yet priority-inheriting: croi's futexes take an owner (K7c), but a
// thread can only name itself with a thread pointer, which croi's user
// threads don't have yet. Until then the owner is left unset.
