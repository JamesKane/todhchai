// them through any Node client, and add what a file system has beyond
// Node: typed attributes, batched listings with attributes, renames,
// queries and live queries, indices, and durability.
//
// A live query's changes come on a channel of their own (LiveQuery), as
// fuchsia.io's directory watchers do, so a Node client on a directory
// channel never sees an event it doesn't know.
